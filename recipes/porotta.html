    <p>Kerala Parotta, also known as Porotta in the southern region of India. It is a typical layered flat Indian bread that is typically sold in eateries and thattukada/roadside stores in Kerala and other South Indian states. Among Keralites, Kerala Parotta with Chilly Beef Fry is a popular dish.</p>
    <p>Parotta originated in the Tamil-populated Jaffna area of Sri Lanka, and the migrant workers from there introduced it as "Veechu Porotta" or "Ceylon Porotta" in coastal Tamil Nadu region of India. In Virudhunagar, traditionally, the parotta is deep fried and is called annai (oil) parotta which is very different from either the veechu parotta or the Malabar parotta. This predates the veechu parotta and has been around for a long time. Parotta became popular all over Kerala during the late 1960s or the early 1980s. During the 1990s, street hawkers (thattukadas) of Kerala further strengthened its status as a local food, and it came to be known as "Kerala Porotta" or "Malabar Parotta" outside of Kerala, owing to the popularity of food from the Malabar region of Kerala which was always globally represented since British times .</p>
